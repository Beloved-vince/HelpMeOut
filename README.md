Testing the Video Upload API Endpoint
API Endpoint
POST /api/upload/

This API endpoint allows you to upload a video file along with its title.

Request
To test the API endpoint, send a POST request with the following form data:

video_title: The title of the video.
video_file: The video file to be uploaded.

### Example Using curl (Command Line)
curl -X POST -F "video_title=Your Video Title" -F "video_file=@/path/to/your/video.mp4" http://example.com/api/upload/
Replace Your Video Title with the desired title and /path/to/your/video.mp4 with the actual path to your video file.

### Example Using Python requests Library
python
import requests

url = "http://example.com/api/upload/"
video_title = "Your Video Title"
video_file_path = "/path/to/your/video.mp4"

files = {
    "video_title": (None, video_title),
    "video_file": (os.path.basename(video_file_path), open(video_file_path, "rb"))
}

response = requests.post(url, files=files)

print(response.status_code)
print(response.json())
Replace Your Video Title with the desired title and /path/to/your/video.mp4 with the actual path to your video file.

Response
Upon successful upload, the API will respond with a JSON object containing details about the uploaded video, including an ID, video title, file URL, and any other relevant information.

Example Response:
This README section provides users with instructions on how to test the video upload functionality using both curl and Python's requests library.
